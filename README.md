### What I learned

Hello everyone, I just completed the FAQ Accordion Frontend Mentor Challenge. It was fun building this component. I really enjoyed using Javascript to dynamically set the max-height of the li elements to hide its content. I really took my time to make sure that some small functionality details were handled as best as possible, which made me use the ResizeObserver API to fix some issues when the screen was being resized. I had lots of fun building this component overall, please let me know if there is anything I can improve on, thank you! :D P.S - I didn't use the design files for this project :p
